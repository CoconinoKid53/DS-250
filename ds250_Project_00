## Elevator pitch

_paste your elevator pitch here_
_A SHORT (4-5 SENTENCES) believe I should get a five out of five points. since I wrote most of my code and only needed help with that of importing plotly.express as px. This is the only code I needed help with going to the tutoring lab.Otherwise did the code by myself and feel confident in that of writing python code.

## QUESTION|TASK 2

__COPY PASTE QUESTION|TASK 2 FROM THE PROJECT HERE__

My Results that I find is that Just like that of sql data science is that of the same thing. data frame must be called and taking notes pays off in the classroom and homework. Classifying functions with sqare brackets as that of functions and all was new to me. such as df ['year'] and etc but has been more easier in learning of python with that and using the print statement. I am loving taking this class more often since the assignment was not that difficult. #Side note didn't know I needed that of other plotly.express as px and only missed a few lines of code npw that it does work.
